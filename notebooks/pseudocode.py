# get input parameters
# perform basic sanity tests
# calculate percent abundances
# 
# open and digest files one by one, then close them
#     open raw digest files one by one, save probability fragments
#     apply percent abundances
# 
# after iterating through all files, get the dictionary of combined counts
#     get the total fragments under curve, get scaling factor for n reads #TODO
#     apply size selection adjustment to all files, while open, new dict #TODO
#     confirm that totals approximate input n reads? #TODO
