# Vignettes to test readsynth

## Step 1: download sample metagenomes

Within one of the vignette subdirectories, run the following shell script to download genomes into the "genomes" subdirectory.

```
bash download_genomes.sh
```

## Step 2: run readsynth

You can investigate the "run_readsynth.sh" file to see the settings used before running as a script:

```
bash run_readsynth.sh
```
